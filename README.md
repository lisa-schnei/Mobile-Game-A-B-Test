# Project: A/B Test Analysis - Cookie Cats

--------------------------------------------
## Project Objective

This dataset includes A/B test results of Cookie Cats ( a mobile game) to examine what happens when the first gate in the game was moved from level 30 to level 40. When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either gate_30 or gate_40.

A gate in the game is a point where the player is forced to wait for some time, or make a purchase to progress, with the goal to drive app sales.  

The goal is to understand if positioning a gate at a later point in the game (at level 40) will have an impact on user retention.
